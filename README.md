# Simple GedLibPy

These small codes aim to help the computation of a ged between two graphs

# How to run test.py
 - Clone and install https://github.com/bgauzere/gedlibpy
 - modify env PYTHONPATH to include your gedlibpy directory
`export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/gedliby/`
 - `pipenv install`
 - `pipenv run python test.py` should work and print approximated ged
